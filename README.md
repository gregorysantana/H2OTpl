# H2OTpl - PHP Template Engine

## Description

“The **simplest and best way** to separate your HTML (template) code from your PHP code while coding in PHP!”

**H2OTpl** is an **easy**, **fast** and **secure** PHP template engine.

It was created for our **H2O Engine** (framework), but now we have decided to create a standalone version for people who don't want to use it with our H2O framework.


## Our other Template Engine

1. **[PHXSLT](http://github.com/pH-7/XSLT-PHP-Template-Engine)** is a [XSLT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT) Template Engine for PHP.

2.  **[PH7Tpl](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/tree/master/_protected/framework/Layout/Tpl/Engine/PH7Tpl)** There is not standalone version available.
pH7Tpl is integrated into our **[pH7Frameowork](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/tree/master/_protected/framework)**. It supports two different syntaxes. The first looks slightly to Smarty syntax and the second is inspired to XSLT/XML syntax but simplified and easier to use.


## Server Requirements

*H2OTpl* class can work with **PHP 5.2**, but not the demo. So, I recommend to have **PHP 5.4** or higher installed.
